One question kept reoccurring to me as I listened to the presentations at the [Energy Research Workshop][energyworkshop] I attended yesterday: how much time do we have to switch over to new sources of energy?

In an ideal world, where we have plenty of time to change energy sources, we would choose the technological path that makes the most sense and has the fewest downsides, develop it, and then build it up to a level that could handle all of our power needs.  So, for example, we might decide that wind power is best suited, on a large scale, to be our primary energy source.  Even if it took 100 years to find all the materials needed to build enough wind turbines--some of the metals used to make wind turbines, like neodymium, are not found or mined in large quantities--we could afford to still emit pollutants from existing power plants and the cars we drive until the new generating capacity was complete.

But, instead, suppose we had only 20 years before climate change caused widespread and irreversible changes that affected most of earth's population.  Then, would we still choose wind power as the best solution to our problem if it took 100 years to complete construction of all those turbines?  Of course not.  Our answer would change depending on exactly how much time we had left and how quickly we thought different solutions would work.  And, if we had very little time, we might even accept that some solution that, at first, seems like a bad idea, might turn out to be a better short-term solution because it saves us from driving off a cliff.

There are actually multiple goals that are driving us to change where we get our energy.  For example, people might like to have a more sustainable source, one that will not run out in 100 years.  In contrast, a country might also want to secure its "energy-independence" by being more self-sufficient in how it generates its energy.  Or, we might need to change how it gets its energy to avoid disastrous changes to the climate that would make it more uncomfortable (or impossible) for us to live on the planet.

Each of these outcomes, however, comes with an associated deadline, and we may not know exactly what that deadline is. That is, if we continue with business-as-usual, will our sources of oil stay stable for 10 years or 50 years?  Will we avoid the worst effects of climate change for 20 or 120 years?  Trying to understand the amount of time associated with each of our goals (and there are certainly more goals than I have mentioned here) should make a big difference in how we approach energy research.

At the workshop yesterday, I noticed that the amount of time people thought we have left affected what they thought was the best solution to our energy problems.  Sometimes, but less frequently, they got it backward too:  what they thought was the best solution actually affected their estimate of how much time was left.  In the next week or so, I plan to post my thoughts on particular topics from the workshop.  But, underlying all of my posts is going to be an understanding that each energy technology has a set of assumptions built into it that affects whether it is an appropriate solution for whatever amount of time we actually have left.

Over time, I hope to develop a shared understanding with you, my reader, about which energy sources make the most sense to develop.
