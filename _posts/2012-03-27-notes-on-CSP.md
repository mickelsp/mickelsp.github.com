I received some comments regarding [my earlier post][CSPpost] on concentrated solar power that I think are worth sharing to the blog readership at large.

One technology that I did not know about is called a [solar draft tower][SolarDraftTowers].  The basic idea is that you build a really tall tower (more than 1000 feet, or about 300 meters, in most designs) and heats air inside a greenhouse area at the bottom of the tower.  Then, that hot air rises through the tower, spinning turbines inside the tower.

The primary advantage of such a power plant is that it does not require very much water compared to most concentrated solar power designs.  The main disadvantage is that the efficiency of such a structure is very low compared to other forms of solar power, turning only 0.5% of incoming solar radiation into usable electricity.  For comparison, photovoltaic panels typically convert about 20% to 30% of the incoming solar energy to usable electricity.

To figure out the trade-offs between a solar draft tower and a CSP plant, I think one would need to do a life cycle analysis (LCA) of both approaches.  I will write more about these in a future post, but in short, life cycle analyses basically account for all the production and construction "costs" in terms of energy, as well as all the outputs (good and bad) in terms of energy. Such an accounting of the two technologies would probably award big points to the updraft towers for their long lifetimes and low maintenance costs, but would give demerits for poor land usage and a higher environmental impact on-site. The outcome of such an analysis is unknown, however, without it having been done.

Water use was another topic that generated comments.  Specifically, since water use is similarly high for CSP plants as for nuclear and coal plants, why would we choose to build any of these in the desert?  I think this is a really good question that needs to be considered in building plants of any kind in places with low water availability.  One alternative way of solving this problem is to use a heat transfer fluid other than water.  For example, people have had some success [using molten salt][MoltenSalt] to serve the same role as water, but there are issues, such as a high freezing point for molten salts, which may need to be overcome for wider adoption.

Finally, in comparing CSP to photovoltaic panels, it was pointed out to me that CSP inherently contains more moving parts (to aim the light at the receiver) than a photovoltaic panel.  Having more moving parts increases the cost and the complexity of CSP.  On the other hand, many photovoltaic panels are also mounted on devices which track the sun and increase the overall collection ability of photovoltaics; moving photovoltaics could negate their cost advantage over CSP generation.  For installation in populated areas, however, (non-moving) photovoltaics really seem to make the most sense because they can be modestly sized and reasonably priced.
