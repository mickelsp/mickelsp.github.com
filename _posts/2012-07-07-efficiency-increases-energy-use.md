You know that paper recycling bin that stands in the hallway of your building? Yeah, the one where you can drop your scraps of scratch paper or messed up printouts on your way to the bathroom or on the way home from work.  Could it actually make you use more paper than if it were not there?  And what about reams of "new" paper, made primarily from recycled material? Might you use more paper overall because you know it has already been recycled?

What if you knew that there was no more paper except what you already have laying around in and around your desk?  How would you use your paper then?  I bet it would look something like this palimpsest:

You would use the paper only if you thought you needed to; you would write in pencil and erase when you were done; you would only write in pen when it was important; and you might even write over or in between previous layers.

How is reusing or recycling paper relevant to a blog about energy?  Well, you might think that a good way to reduce your energy use is to make all your stuff more energy efficient, but you would be (partly) wrong.  In the context of paper, making it easy to recycle can actually increase the demand for paper from both virgin and recycled sources rather than reducing the total amount of paper that needs to be produced.  In terms of energy, using less energy for the same function usually means that it is cheaper to use more energy overall.  This conundrum is seemingly paradoxical and, in fact, has its own name: [Jevons paradox][jevons].  [Books have even been written about it][jevonsbook]!

[Jevons argued][jevons], in the 19th century, that the amount of coal consumed in Britain would not be reduced by increasing the efficiency of coal-burning machines and, in fact, would actually increase because coal became effectively cheaper bcause of advances in coal-burning technology.  In most cases, however, even when energy becomes cheaper to use, there are [confounding factors][realclimate] which ...

Then, connect to fact that it might be beneficial to levy fines/taxes/etc... on things in order to discourage their use because higher costs are one of the most potent drivers of using less.
