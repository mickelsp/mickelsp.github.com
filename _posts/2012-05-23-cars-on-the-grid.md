Okay, I admit, there are some ideas in energy that I run across that I get excited about out of proportion to their actual importance or current impact.  Often, there is something diabolically clever or elegant about such an idea.

Case in point:  using electric cars as storage for the electric grid.  In her book, [<cite>Before the Lights Go Out</cite>][lightsoutbook], Maggie Koerth-Baker discusses how the electric grid is ill-suited to handling large fluctuations in the supply or demand of electricity.  Because neither solar nor wind power yield constant output, they will prove challenging to incorporate into the electric grid on a large scale.  Further exacerbating the problem is the fact that not all conventional power plants can be quickly turned on or off in response to fluctuations in the supply or demand for electricity.  

The solution to fluctuations in electricity is to implement large-scale storage of energy.  There are [a number of ideas][gridstorage] for such storage, but Koerth-Baker points out that—and this is the diabolically clever idea!—a sufficiently large number of electric cars plugged into the grid could serve as a store of electricity.  By adding or subtracting a small amount of electricity from the car battery of each electric car on the grid, fluctuations in the grid supply could be smoothed out.

What could make this feasible is that our cars sit unused, according to Koerth-Baker, 96% of the time.  So as long as they are plugged in, the cars' batteries act as a giant, collective battery that sops up any extra power on the grid or supplies some amount back to account for drops in renewable energy generation.  The advantages of such a scheme are 1) no monolithic, large-capacity batteries have to be bought, at great expense, by an electricity utility and 2) the storage capacity of the network is more resilient.

While this is [a scheme that has already been tested in Delaware][delawaretest], it will be a long time, if ever, before electric cars contribute in this fashion.  Pre-requisites for the scheme include increased ownership of electric cars and the existence of millions of electric car charging stations that are connected to the electric grid.  Nevertheless, it is a fascinating idea that I find myself (perhaps irrationally) excited about.
