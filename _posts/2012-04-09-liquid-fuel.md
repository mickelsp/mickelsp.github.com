So tell me, smarty pants:  if we're not allowed to emit carbon dioxide by the metric ton anymore\*, how am I going to be able to fly around the world without jet fuel?  It isn't as if I can stick a battery in my plane because there's no battery in existence that contains enough energy for a long trip (except [maybe here][thomasjetengine]).  Not to mention that if a battery fails in a Prius, I can probably pull over the car to the side of the road, whereas if the battery goes in my plane, then I am going to be in a world of hurt.

Biofuels are one possible replacement for liquid jet fuel.  In this post, I will discuss why jet fuel is hard to replace and introduce biofuel as an alternative fuel.  To begin, take a look at the following graph which shows the amount of energy found in different fuels:


<div align="center">
<img src="/images/Materials_Energy_Density.png" alt="Graph of volumetric energy density versus mass energy density"><br>
<small>Graph which shows the energy density of selected fuels.  Fuels derived from crude oil have very good energy density, while batteries have poor energy density in comparison.  Though biodiesel or ethanol-based fuels cannot solve all our liquid fuel needs, they could be a more environmentally friendly alternative for particular applications like jet fuel. Data from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">Wikipedia</a>.</small>

On the horizontal axis of the graph, you see how much energy there is per kilogram of material while on the vertical axis you see how much energy there is per liter of material.  We care about energy density in terms of the mass because we want to avoid needing large quantities of fuel, and we care about the energy density in terms of the volume because we don't want the fuel to [take up lots of space][hydrogencartoon] (*Yes, you should visit that link*).  On this graph, the best fuels in terms of energy density will show up higher up and more to the right.

From this graph, you can see that jet fuel is actually quite good because it packs a lot of energy into a relatively small space.  Batteries barely even show up on the chart (bottom left corner) because they contain so little energy, thus demonstrating how ridiculous it would be to try to make a battery-powered airplane.  So, any replacement for jet fuel has to have a lot of the same properties as jet fuel, but without the harmful environmental impact.

Let me get this out of the way right now:  biofuels "cheat" to be considered an environmentally friendly alternative to jet fuel.  Biofuels are chemically very similar to jet fuel and show up at a similar place on the graph I showed you (e,g, biodiesel, or the slightly less efficient ethanol), and therefore, they emit similar levels of greenhouse gases when they are burned for energy.  They are better for the environment than jet fuels because of the way in which they are produced.  Whereas fossil fuels contain carbon that has been sequestered in the ground for millions of years in the form of crude oil, biofuels are generated by growing plant material on the surface of the earth.  The growing process itself takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and creates a closed cycle for the carbon in the biofuel.  To recap:
- growing a biofuel pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere;
- burning the biofuel puts the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere;
- growing the next generation of plants used for biofuel will pull the carbon dioxide back out.
- the net effect will be that a biofuel is carbon neutral, but that it will not be carbon-less.

Making biofuels requires growing plants.  For example, ethanol can come from growing corn and fermenting the corn to turn it into fuel (kind of like how you brew beer...).  Other sources of biofuel include fast growing switchgrasses or algae pools (see image below) which, [according to one company][algenol], may even be able to produce ethanol without having to kill the algae.  At the most basic level, however, you need to generate a large quantity of biomass that can then be converted into biofuels.  This conversion process requires energy itself to happen, and the details of biofuel production can make a substantial difference in how cost-effective it turns out to be.

Algae grows much faster than many plants, however, and can grow in pools of non-potable water.  Using algae as the biomass for biofuels could help avoid tension between using agricultural land for food and non-food crops.

In a future post, I will address more of the details of biofuel production, but here I want to finish by discussing some of the drawbacks of biofuel production.  One problem comes from the fact that we have limited land on which to grow plant matter.  A lot (or most?) of farmland should be dedicated to food production.  If, instead, land is used to produce biofuels, we reduce the amount of food that can be produced for an increasing population, though some people claim ([report forthcoming][ukDOEreport]) that biofuels can be grown in places food crops cannot.  Also, as the climate changes more over the next century, it will [affect the amount of arable land][arableland]\*\*, probably leading to more conflict in how to produce environmentally friendly liquid fuels.  Either way, if the demand for biofuels increases by ten or a hundred times the current levels, it is hard to believe that there will be enough land to generate the required biomass.

Ultimately, biofuels may only help us in limited ways.  Rather than being looked at as a replacement for powering your car—where batteries or other technologies are better solutions—biofuels can be seen as an alternative to the otherwise-tricky-to-solve problem of lessening the environmental impact of air travel.

<small>*Because of climate change, of course.  <a href="http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Fsr/?src=/climate/ipcc/aviation/006.htm">Aviation contributes a large proportion of the greenhouse gases</a> emitted by the transportation sector, which then, because these gases are emitted at altitude rather than at the surface, exert a disproportionate influence on the atmosphere .
