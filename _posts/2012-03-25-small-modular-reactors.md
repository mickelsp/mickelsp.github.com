Two presentations at the [Energy Research Workshop][energyworkshop] were dedicated to talking about the prospects for nuclear energy in today's world.  The first made the case that the only way to meet our energy goals for the next 25 years is to build more nuclear energy plants while the second argued that small modular nuclear reactors are the best choice for new nuclear plants.  In this post, I will focus on the latter topic, but first I want to think about nuclear energy more broadly.

Why do people get excited about nuclear energy?  Because you want your energy source to have lots of energy for a very small quantity AND you would like your energy source not to take up too much space.  Uranium-235, a commonly used nuclear fuel, meets both of these criteria.  For instance, you would need [16,000 times more coal than Uranium-235 (by weight)][uraniumcoalcomp] to generate the same amount of electricity.

Nuclear energy is also appealing because climate change is a significant concern in today's world and because many traditional sources of energy (e.g. coal and oil) spit out tons of pollutants which exacerbate climate change.  In contrast, nuclear energy is a zero-carbon-emission source of electricity and does not directly contribute to climate change.  (It is energy intensive to process into a usable form, however, and [most of the uranium used in the United States is actually imported][uraniumimport] from other countries, so processing and transport indirectly contribute to climate change.)

So if the advantages of nuclear energy are so great, why are we not building nuclear plants as fast as possible?  Because it is expensive.  And secondarily, because there are [safety concerns that surround nuclear plants][nuclearsafety].  Of course, the two things are not independent of each other because necessary safety regulations do increase the cost of building and operating a nuclear power plant.  The high capital cost of building nuclear plants means [no new plants have been commissioned since 1975][lastpermitted] and of those, [only one has been completed in the last twenty years][lastplantbuilt].  Furthermore, if you look at the size of different power companies, [investing up to $17 billion][costofplant] in a new, full-sized nuclear plant can mean betting the existence of the entire company on one project.  That is a tall order and a big reason why nuclear is a hard sell without significant government subsidies.

[Small modular nuclear reactors][SMApresentation] are a possible solution to the cost conundrum.  Jose Reyes, the co-founder of a startup nuclear power company (sounds funny, right?) called [NuScale Power][nuclearstartup], told us attendees of the [Energy Research Workshop][energyworkshop] how, because of their modest size, small modular reactors could be assembled off-site at a factory and then shipped to the site of a nuclear power plant.  Reyes claimed that making more reactors would reduce their individual cost because of economies of scale, but as [this study shows][smallvslargestudy], for the same amount of total generating power, small modular reactors have about the same price tag as large nuclear power plants.  It is true, however, that a smaller reactor design also means that it is easier to build one or two at first—with the possibility of adding more reactor modules later—another cost-saving benefit for a company trying to build a plant from scratch.

Reyes also argued that situating the reactor cores underground would reduce some of the safety concerns associated with above-ground plants.  First, situating the modules underground would help restrict access to the plants, a security advantage against 9/11-style threats.  Secondly, reactors which are at risk of over-heating after an accident could  have water added to them more easily by being below-ground. For instance, containment efforts at Fukushima were complicated by having to spray water onto the nuclear material containment vessels located on top of buildings, and small modular reactors might avoid this scenario in an emergency.  Being below-ground is not always an advantage, however.  Locating backup generators and other electronics below ground can [increase the plant's susceptibility to flooding][ucsreport] and make it more difficult for crews to access the reactor in an emergency.

Cooling of nuclear material after it has undergone fission is always one of the biggest safety concerns to address with nuclear power plants.  The argument in favor of small modular reactors is that [passive cooling][passivecooling] (simply by having either water or air around the reactor) is sufficient to safely contain nuclear material in an emergency.  Since there is simply less material, then there is less heat generated and there is thus enough water around the containment vessel to bring the reactor down to a low enough temperature to be air-cooled.  It is not clear, however, what would happen [if multiple units in an area were damaged or if individual passive components (e.g. valves) lost functionality][ucsreport] as the result of an accident.

Ultimately, the success of small modular nuclear reactors will depend on addressing safety concerns to at least the level of existing nuclear reactors.  This process will also have to include satisfactory solutions to disposal of radioactive material, an issue that pertains to both large and small nuclear plants.  If it costs too much to meet these standards, then it seems unlikely that small reactors will contribute to the energy landscape no matter their potential benefits.
