*Neodymium. Praeseodymium. Terbium. Gallium. Europium. Lanthanum. Lithium. Samarium. Germanium. Dysprosium.*  What do these names mean to you?  What relevance can they possibly have to your life?  No, they're not diseases you can contract, but rather examples of uncommon chemical elements that are all-important to renewable energy technologies in one way or another.

An underreported aspect of the drive towards renewable energies is the need for unusual and/or hard-to-find elements to be used in wind turbines (*neodymium, dysprosium, praeseodymium, samarium*), car batteries (*lithium, lanthanum*), solar panels (*gallium, germanium*), or even compact fluorescent light bulbs (*terbium, europium*).  Many of these elements are categorized as "rare earth" elements, though they are not necessarily very rare.  What makes them important is that since they constitute critical parts of renewable energy technologies, they will be needed in increasing quantities over the coming decades as we build ever greater numbers of solar panels, wind turbines, and electric car batteries.    

The issues that these [energy critical elements][ECEs]\* have in common are related to extraction and geopolitics.  Whether an element is considered to be "energy critical" may change over time depending on technology or circumstances.  For example, until technical advances made aluminum production more efficient, aluminum ([$1 per ounce in 1884][ALprice]) was [as expensive as silver][AGprice] even though aluminum is the [third most abundant element found in the earth's crust][ALabundance].  Further, consider what would happen to the electric car market should the country of Bolivia become less politically stable:  [with over half of the world's lithium reserves][LIreserves], Bolivia is a place to pay attention to.

Extraction of energy critical elements can be difficult, both because of where they are located geographically and how they are produced geologically.  Even when elements are relatively common, they may not be found in rich veins of high purity (e.g. *germanium*), thus making them hard and expensive to mine.  Further complicating matters is that some elements are only the co-products of mining other, more common metals (e.g. *gallium* is extracted [at the same time as aluminum and zinc][GAcoproduction]), thus making for interesting economic trade-offs when trying to extract more of the less-common element.

Geopolitically, obtaining energy critical elements can be complicated when most of an element is found and/or mined only in one or two countries (e.g. *neodymium* is mostly mined in China, *platinum* in South Africa, and *lithium* in Bolivia).  Such a monopoly on important elements enables market manipulation much like Saudi Arabia's oil riches allow it the possibility of affecting oil prices around the world.  In contrast, some countries will not even consider mining certain elements because the environmental impact is too high, and so mining of elements becomes concentrated in countries willing to tolerate these kinds of environmental costs.

Are there ways that we can mitigate the effect of a limited supply of energy critical elements?  One of the simplest things is recycling energy critical elements from used equipment.  In many cases, the purity of the metal in existing equipment is already very high making it advantageous to prolong the supply of the metal via recycling, However the cost of recycling can initially be high until enough material is recycled to create an economy of scale.  Another solution is to support research into finding acceptable substitutes for elements which are being used up currently.  Chemically similar substitute elements often can play the same role as the original element in making a functional device.

Ultimately, we need to recognize that our push to renewable energy will require obtaining the energy critical elements necessary to achieve our clean energy goals.  Thinking ahead and planning for substitute elements will help us avoid falling back onto dirty energy technologies.
