A dinner conversation the other day got me thinking: anthropogenic climate change—in large part due to increasing emissions of carbon dioxide—is happening rapidly (and [increasingly inevitably][CO2effect]), but how much do the various sources of carbon dioxide contribute to the problem? My dining companions and I anecdotally knew many facts about carbon sources: "Burning fossil fuels generates a lot of carbon dioxide". "Transportation contributes, especially airplanes". "Generating electricity must be a large source". Thus our conversation went. But without a clear sense of the proportions of each of these carbon dioxide sources, we found it difficult to know where  emissions reductions would come from.

That sounds like the kind of question that should be answered with a smart phone...or a blog post! Therefore, I present you with a pie chart, the perfect dessert item for this particular dinner conversation:

</div>


A few things jump out at me:  first of all, electricity and transportation make up more than 70% of all carbon dioxide emissions.  Secondly, the 14% that industry contributes does not count electricity generation, so industry generates quite a bit of carbon dioxide independently of the energy required to manufacture products and/or to extract materials.  Finally, we consumers are not without guilt, as we contribute to the carbon dioxide load just by living in our own homes.

Diving a little deeper, the chart above does not tell you anything about what kinds of transportation generate the most carbon dioxide. The [Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks][ghginventory] reveals that a massive 65% of all U.S. transportation emissions result from combustion in motor vehicles.  Almost all the rest comes from burning diesel and jet fuel in heavy trucks and aircraft.

One final thought: reducing carbon dioxide emissions is not necessarily straight-forward. Suppose you decide to drive an electric car instead of a gas-powered vehicle:  great!  You just stopped burning fossil fuels on account of your transportation, but how is the electricity that recharges your car's battery generated? If power generation does not also change to a cleaner source, then you have made less of a dent in the problem than you would like.  At the dinner table, though, we did agree that riding a bike circumvents both problems and is a lot more fun than worrying about global climate change.
